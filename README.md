- We propose Attention FocusNet and SE-Attention U-Net models as an automatic
end-to-end dermoscopic lesion delineation models. Attention FocusNet
exploits AG which can effectively remove lower-level irrelevant information
from the network. SENet in SE-Attention U-Net re-calibrates the channel
inter dependencies, feeding it into the AG, which improves the model in
terms of performance metrics.
– Extensive experimental results on the datasets ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018 and
HAM10000 are produced which demonstrates that the gating applied have
precisely and accurately identified the small and intricate lesions in the images.
– To the best of our knowledge, this is our initiative to analyze the combined
effect of SENet and AG on FocusNet architecture with detailed experimentation on three datasets.
