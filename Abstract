Abstract. Nowadays, the attention mechanism is widely used in image
segmentation. Recently many attention gate (AG) based models have
gained interest for use in the delineation processes. However, adding
only AG in the models can sometimes produce fallacious results due
to irregular lesion boundaries and illumination variation conditions. To
address these issues, we propose two novel methods, Attention FocusNet
and SE-Attention U-Net. Attention FocusNet focuses on the use of AG
to get much improved hierarchical attention maps and lowers the details
of irrelevant information in the model to create a segmented image mask.
SE-Attention U-Net, on the other hand, re-calibrates the weights of the
feature vector and pass it through AG to focus on relevant information
and suppressing any superficial information. We experimented on three
medical image datasets, which are ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018 and HAM10000.
Validation results show that the proposed methods outperform the state
of-the-art methodologies and obtained better segmentation accuracy.
